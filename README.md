# websec - Some web security stuff.

* This repository contains some self-explaining examples of the most important concepts in web security.
  They are explanation, example and playground in one!
* Simply open ``index.html`` in Firefox as a ``file:///``. **Do NOT run it as a webserver!**
  Regarding the SOP, all ``file:///`` URIs are treated as totally unique origins; and this is how the examples have been built!
* They have been tested with Firefox and with **Firefox** only! (version 115.0.2, macOS)
